Handwritten Text Recognition Using CNN and LSTM

Introduction
Handwritten text recognition models have great potential, especially in this
modern digitalized world. It is important to move towards a paperless environ-
ment in almost all sectors for a sustainable future. This report demonstrates a
novel handwritten text detection and recognition pipeline to convert handwrit-
ten text into digital text. The model is achieved using deep learning techniques,
specifically leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extrac-
tion and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction.
This combination enables effective recognition of handwritten text from images,
improving efficiency and accuracy in text conversion tasks.

Objective of the Project
• Digitalizing Important Handwritten Documents: The project aims
to create a model capable of accurately converting handwritten documents
into machine-readable text, thereby promoting a paperless and more effi-
cient document management system.
• Creating Text-to-Speech Algorithm: Using the recognized text, the
system will convert it into speech, assisting in accessibility for visually im-
paired users or people who prefer audio formats.
• Using AI Methods to Extract Meaningful Information from Hand-
written Data: The recognition system will incorporate AI techniques to
go beyond basic text conversion, providing meaningful insights from the
recognized content, such as extracting key phrases, entities, or sentiment.
• Translating Important Handwritten Scripts: The project will include
a feature for automatic translation of recognized handwritten scripts into
different languages, aiding in communication and accessibility across differ-
ent linguistic groups.
• Enhancing Recognition Accuracy and Efficiency: The project fo-
cuses on improving the accuracy and speed of handwritten text recognition,
utilizing advanced deep learning techniques and optimizing model perfor-
mance for real-time applications.
• Real-World Applications: The system aims to address real-world chal-
lenges, including the digitization of historical documents, automated data
entry, and providing assistance in scenarios where handwritten text is cru-
cial but difficult to interpret by traditional methods.

Data Overview
The handwritten text dataset used in this project is sourced from a well-
established benchmark, featuring samples from over 600 writers worldwide. With
over 1000 pages of handwritten text, this dataset provides diverse examples of
handwriting styles, making it suitable for training deep learning models for hand-
writing recognition. The dataset contains both individual word images and their
corresponding labels, allowing for supervised learning of character sequences. It
is divided into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model evaluation
and performance tracking. This dataset serves as a comprehensive foundation for
developing and testing advanced handwriting recognition systems.

Model Architecture
The architecture of the Handwriting Recognition model is designed to process
image data and convert it into readable text. Each layer is selected to capture
and interpret various aspects of the handwriting sequence:
• Input Layer: Accepts the image data, serving as the entry point for the
handwritten text images to be processed.
• Convolutional Layers: These layers automatically learn spatial features
like edges, curves, and textures from the input images. The convolutional
layers help the model identify key components of the handwriting, such as
letters and strokes, which are crucial for text recognition.
• MaxPooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps
produced by the convolutional layers. This helps to focus on the most
important features and makes the model more efficient by reducing the
amount of data processed, which is crucial when dealing with large images.
• Reshape Layer: Prepares the output of the convolutional layers for se-
quential processing. By reformatting the data, it ensures the model can
handle the spatial data as sequences, necessary for recognizing handwriting
that is sequential in nature.
• Dense Layers: These fully connected layers are responsible for interpreting
complex patterns learned from the convolutional layers. They allow the
model to form higher-level representations of the image features, helping in
classifying the handwriting into specific characters or words.

• Dropout Layer: Helps prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating some
neurons during training, ensuring the model generalizes well to new, unseen
handwriting examples.
• Bidirectional LSTM Layers: These layers are key to capturing tempo-
ral dependencies in handwriting. By processing the image data in both
forward and backward directions, the model can understand context from
both the past and future strokes, improving recognition accuracy for com-
plex sequences.
• CTC Loss: The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss func-
tion enables the model to make predictions for unaligned sequence data,
which is essential when the timing or alignment between input and out-
put sequences (such as handwriting strokes to characters) is not explicitly
known.
Each layer is strategically used to process and interpret handwritten text
in different ways, from feature extraction to sequence prediction, making this
architecture well-suited for handwriting recognition tasks.
